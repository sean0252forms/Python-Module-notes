Your first function
Take a look at the snippet in the editor.

It's rather simple, but we only want it to be an example of transforming a repeating part of a code into a function.

The messages sent to the console by the print() function are always the same. Of course, there's nothing really bad in such a code, but try to imagine what you would have to do if your boss asked you to change the message to make it more polite, e.g., to start it with the phrase "Please,".

It seems that you'd have to spend some time changing all the occurrences of the message (you'd use a clipboard, of course, but it wouldn't make your life much easier). It's obvious that you'd probably make some mistakes during the amendment process, and you (and your boss) would get a bit frustrated.


Is it possible to separate such a repeatable part of the code, name it and make it reusable? It would mean that a change made once in one place would be propagated to all the places where it's used.

Of course, such a code should work only when it's explicitly launched.

Yes, it's possible. This is exactly what functions are for.
