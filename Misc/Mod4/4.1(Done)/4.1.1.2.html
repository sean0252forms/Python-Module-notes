Decomposition
It often happens that the problem is so large and complex that it cannot be assigned to a single developer, and a team of developers have to work on it. The problem must be split between several developers in a way that ensures their efficient and seamless cooperation.

The concept of sharing the work/working together


It seems inconceivable that more than one programmer should write the same piece of code at the same time, so the job has to be dispersed among all the team members.

This kind of decomposition has a different purpose to the one described previously - it's not only about sharing the work, but also about sharing the responsibility among many developers.

Each of them writes a clearly defined and described set of functions, which when combined into the module (we'll tell you about this a bit later) will give the final product.



This leads us directly to the third condition: if you're going to divide the work among multiple programmers, decompose the problem to allow the product to be implemented as a set of separately written functions packed together in different modules.

Where do the functions come from?
In general, functions come from at least three places:

from Python itself - numerous functions (like print()) are an integral part of Python, and are always available without any additional effort on behalf of the programmer; we call these functions built-in functions;
from Python's preinstalled modules - a lot of functions, very useful ones, but used significantly less often than built-in ones, are available in a number of modules installed together with Python; the use of these functions requires some additional steps from the programmer in order to make them fully accessible (we'll tell you about this in a while);
directly from your code - you can write your own functions, place them inside your code, and use them freely;
there is one other possibility, but it's connected with classes, so we'll omit it for now.
