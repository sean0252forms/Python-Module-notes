Your first function
How do you make such a function?

You need to define it. The word define is significant here.

This is what the simplest function definition looks like:

def function_name():
    function_body


It always starts with the keyword def (for define)
next after def goes the name of the function (the rules for naming functions are exactly the same as for naming variables)
after the function name, there's a place for a pair of parentheses (they contain nothing here, but that will change soon)
the line has to be ended with a colon;
the line directly after def begins the function body - a couple (at least one) of necessarily nested instructions, which will be executed every time the function is invoked; note: the function ends where the nesting ends, so you have to be careful.

We're ready to define our prompting function. We'll name it message - here it is:

def message():
    print("Enter a value: ")


The function is extremely simple, but fully usable. We've named it message, but you can label it according to your taste. Let's use it.


Our code contains the function definition now:

def message():
    print("Enter a value: ")

print("We start here.")
print("We end here.")


Note: we don't use the function at all - there's no invocation of it inside the code.

When you run it, you see the following output:

We start here.
We end here.
output


This means that Python reads the function's definitions and remembers them, but won't launch any of them without your permission.

We've modified the code now - we've inserted the function's invocation between the start and end messages:

def message():
    print("Enter a value: ")

print("We start here.")
message()
print("We end here.")


The output looks different now:

We start here.
Enter a value: 
We end here.
output


Test the code, modify it, experiment with it.
