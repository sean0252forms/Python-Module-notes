Key takeaways: tuples and dictionaries

Exercise 1

What happens when you attempt to run the following snippet?

my_tup = (1, 2, 3)
print(my_tup[2])


Check

Exercise 2

What is the output of the following snippet?

tup = 1, 2, 3
a, b, c = tup

print(a * b * c)


Check

Exercise 3

Complete the code to correctly use the count() method to find the number of duplicates of 2 in the following tuple.

tup = 1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 7, 2, 8, 9
duplicates = # Write your code here.

print(duplicates)    # outputs: 4


Check

Exercise 4

Write a program that will "glue" the two dictionaries (d1 and d2) together and create a new one (d3).

d1 = {'Adam Smith': 'A', 'Judy Paxton': 'B+'}
d2 = {'Mary Louis': 'A', 'Patrick White': 'C'}
d3 = {}

for item in (d1, d2):
    # Write your code here.

print(d3)

Exercise 5

Write a program that will convert the my_list list to a tuple.

my_list = ["car", "Ford", "flower", "Tulip"]

t =  # Write your code here.
print(t)


Check

Exercise 6

Write a program that will convert the colors tuple to a dictionary.

colors = (("green", "#008000"), ("blue", "#0000FF"))

# Write your code here.

print(colors_dictionary)


Check

Exercise 7

What will happen when you run the following code?

my_dictionary = {"A": 1, "B": 2}
copy_my_dictionary = my_dictionary.copy()
my_dictionary.clear()

print(copy_my_dictionary)


Check

Exercise 8

What is the output of the following program?

colors = {
    "white": (255, 255, 255),
    "grey": (128, 128, 128),
    "red": (255, 0, 0),
    "green": (0, 128, 0)
    }

for col, rgb in colors.items():
    print(col, ":", rgb)
