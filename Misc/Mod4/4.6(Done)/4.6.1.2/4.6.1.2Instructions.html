How to use a tuple?
If you want to get the elements of a tuple in order to read them over, you can use the same conventions to which you're accustomed while using lists.

Take a look at the code in the editor.

The program should produce the following output - run it and check:

1
1000
(10, 100, 1000)
(1, 10)
1
10
100
1000
output


The similarities may be misleading - don't try to modify a tuple's contents! It's not a list!

All of these instructions (except the topmost one) will cause a runtime error:

my_tuple = (1, 10, 100, 1000)

my_tuple.append(10000)
del my_tuple[0]
my_tuple[1] = -10


This is the message that Python will give you in the console window:

AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'append'
output
