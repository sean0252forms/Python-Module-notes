How to use a dictionary?
If you want to get any of the values, you have to deliver a valid key value:

print(dictionary['cat'])
print(phone_numbers['Suzy'])


Getting a dictionary's value resembles indexing, especially thanks to the brackets surrounding the key's value.

Note:

if the key is a string, you have to specify it as a string;
keys are case-sensitive: 'Suzy' is something different from 'suzy'.
The snippet outputs two lines of text:

chat
5557654321
output


And now the most important news: you mustn't use a non-existent key. Trying something like this:

print(phone_numbers['president'])


will cause a runtime error. Try to do it.


Fortunately, there's a simple way to avoid such a situation. The in operator, together with its companion, not in, can salvage this situation.

The following code safely searches for some French words:

dictionary = {"cat": "chat", "dog": "chien", "horse": "cheval"}
words = ['cat', 'lion', 'horse']

for word in words:
    if word in dictionary:
        print(word, "->", dictionary[word])
    else:
        print(word, "is not in dictionary")


The code's output looks as follows:

cat -> chat
lion is not in dictionary
horse -> cheval
output

NOTE

When you write a big or lengthy expression, it may be a good idea to keep it vertically aligned. This is how you can make your code more readable and more programmer-friendly, e.g.:

# Example 1:
dictionary = {
              "cat": "chat",
              "dog": "chien",
              "horse": "cheval"
              }

# Example 2:
phone_numbers = {'boss': 5551234567,
                 'Suzy': 22657854310
                 }


Such ways of formatting code are called hanging indents.
