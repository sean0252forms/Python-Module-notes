How to use a dictionary: the keys()
Can dictionaries be browsed using the for loop, like lists or tuples?

No and yes.

No, because a dictionary is not a sequence type - the for loop is useless with it.

Yes, because there are simple and very effective tools that can adapt any dictionary to the for loop requirements (in other words, building an intermediate link between the dictionary and a temporary sequence entity).

The first of them is a method named keys(), possessed by each dictionary. The method returns an iterable object consisting of all the keys gathered within the dictionary. Having a group of keys enables you to access the whole dictionary in an easy and handy way.

Just like here:

dictionary = {"cat": "chat", "dog": "chien", "horse": "cheval"}

for key in dictionary.keys():
    print(key, "->", dictionary[key]


The code's output looks as follows:

horse -> cheval
dog -> chien
cat -> chat
output


The sorted() function
Do you want it sorted? Just enrich the for loop to get such a form:

for key in sorted(dictionary.keys()):


The sorted() function will do its best - the output will look like this:

cat -> chat
dog -> chien
horse -> cheval
output
