How to use a dictionary: The items() and values() methods
Another way is based on using a dictionary's method named items(). The method returns tuples (this is the first example where tuples are something more than just an example of themselves) where each tuple is a key-value pair.

This is how it works:

dictionary = {"cat": "chat", "dog": "chien", "horse": "cheval"}

for english, french in dictionary.items():
    print(english, "->", french)


Note the way in which the tuple has been used as a for loop variable.

The example prints:

cat -> chat
dog -> chien
horse -> cheval
output


There is also a method named values(), which works similarly to keys(), but returns values.

Here is a simple example:

dictionary = {"cat": "chat", "dog": "chien", "horse": "cheval"}

for french in dictionary.values():
    print(french)


As the dictionary is not able to automatically find a key for a given value, the role of this method is rather limited.

Here is the expected output:

cheval
chien
chat
output
