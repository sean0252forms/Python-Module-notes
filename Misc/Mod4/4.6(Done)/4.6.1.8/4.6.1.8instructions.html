How to use a dictionary: modifying and adding values
Assigning a new value to an existing key is simple - as dictionaries are fully mutable, there are no obstacles to modifying them.

We're going to replace the value "chat" with "minou", which is not very accurate, but it will work well with our example.

Look:

dictionary = {"cat": "chat", "dog": "chien", "horse": "cheval"}

dictionary['cat'] = 'minou'
print(dictionary)


The output is:

{'cat': 'minou', 'dog': 'chien', 'horse': 'cheval'}
output


Adding a new key
Adding a new key-value pair to a dictionary is as simple as changing a value - you only have to assign a value to a new, previously non-existent key.

Note: this is very different behavior compared to lists, which don't allow you to assign values to non-existing indices.

Let's add a new pair of words to the dictionary - a bit weird, but still valid:

dictionary = {"cat": "chat", "dog": "chien", "horse": "cheval"}

dictionary['swan'] = 'cygne'
print(dictionary)


The example outputs:

{'cat': 'chat', 'dog': 'chien', 'horse': 'cheval', 'swan': 'cygne'}
output


EXTRA

You can also insert an item to a dictionary by using the update() method, e.g.:

dictionary = {"cat": "chat", "dog": "chien", "horse": "cheval"}

dictionary.update({"duck": "canard"})
print(dictionary)


Removing a key
Can you guess how to remove a key from a dictionary?

Note: removing a key will always cause the removal of the associated value. Values cannot exist without their keys.

This is done with the del instruction.

Here's the example:

dictionary = {"cat": "chat", "dog": "chien", "horse": "cheval"}

del dictionary['dog']
print(dictionary)


Note: removing a non-existing key causes an error.

The example outputs:

{'cat': 'chat', 'horse': 'cheval'}
output


EXTRA

To remove the last item in a dictionary, you can use the popitem() method:

dictionary = {"cat": "chat", "dog": "chien", "horse": "cheval"}

dictionary.popitem()
print(dictionary)    # outputs: {'cat': 'chat', 'dog': 'chien'}


In the older versions of Python, i.e., before 3.6.7, the popitem() method removes a random item from a dictionary.
