print debugging
This form of debugging, which can be applied to your code using any kind of debugger, is sometimes called interactive debugging. The meaning of the term is self-explanatory – the process needs your (the developer's) interaction to be performed.

Some other debugging techniques can be used to hunt bugs. It's possible that you aren't able or don't want to use a debugger (the reasons may vary). Are you helpless then? Absolutely not!

You may use one of the simplest and the oldest (but still useful) debugging tactics known as print debugging. The name speaks for itself – you just insert several additional print() invocations inside your code to output data which illustrates the path your code is currently negotiating. You can output the values of the variables which may affect the execution.

These printouts may output meaningful text like "I am here", "I entered the foo() function", "The result is 0", or they may contain sequences of characters that are legible only to you. Please don't use obscene or indecent words for the purpose, even though you may feel a strong temptation – your reputation can be ruined in a moment if these antics leak to the public.



As you can see, this kind of debugging isn't really interactive at all, or is interactive only to a small extent, when you decide to apply the input() function to stop or delay code execution.

After the bugs are found and removed, the additional printouts may be commented out or removed – it's up to you. Don't let them be executed in the final code – they may confuse both testers and users, and bring bad karma down upon you.
