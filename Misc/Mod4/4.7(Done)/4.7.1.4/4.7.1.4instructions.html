The exception proves the rule
Let's rewrite the code to adopt the Python approach to life:

Let us summarize what we talked about:

any part of the code placed between try and except is executed in a very special way â€“ any error which occurs here won't terminate program execution. Instead, the control will immediately jump to the first line situated after the except keyword, and no other part of the try branch is executed;

the code in the except branch is activated only when an exception has been encountered inside the try block. There is no way to get there by any other means;

when either the try block or the except block is executed successfully, the control returns to the normal path of execution, and any code located beyond in the source file is executed as if nothing happened.
Now we want to ask you an innocent question: is ValueError the only way the control could fall into the except branch?

Analyze the code carefully and think over your answer!
