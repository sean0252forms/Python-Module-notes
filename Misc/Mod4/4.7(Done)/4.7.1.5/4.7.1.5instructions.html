How to deal with more than one exception
The answer is obviously "no" – there is more than one possible way to raise an exception. For example, a user may enter zero as an input – can you predict what will happen next?

Yes, you're right – the division placed inside the print() function invocation will raise the ZeroDivisionError. As you may expect, the code's behavior will be the same as in the previous case – the user will see the "I do not know what to do..." message, which seems to be quite reasonable in this context, but it's also possible that you would want to handle this kind of problem in a bit different way.

Is it possible? Of course, it is. There are at least two approaches you can implement here.

The first of them is simple and complicated at the same time: you can just add two separate try blocks, one including the input() function invocation where the ValueError may be raised, and the second devoted to handling possible issues induced by the division. Both these try blocks would have their own except branches, and in effect you will gain full control over two different errors.

This solution is good, but it is a bit lengthy – the code becomes unnecessarily bloated. Moreover, it's not the only danger that awaits you. Note that leaving the first try-except block leaves a lot of uncertainty – you will have to add extra code to ensure that the value the user has entered is safe to use in division. This is how a seemingly simple solution becomes overly complicated.

Fortunately, Python offers a simpler way to deal with this kind of challenge.

Two exceptions after one try
Look at the code in the editor. As you can see, we've just introduced the second except branch. This is not the only difference – note that both branches have exception names specified. In this variant, each of the expected exceptions has its own way of handling the error, but it must be emphasized that only one of all branches can intercept the control – if one of the branches is executed, all the other branches remain idle.

Additionally, the number of except branches is not limited – you can specify as many or as few of them as you need, but don't forget that none of the exceptions can be specified more than once.

But this still isn't the last Python word on exceptions. Stay tuned.
