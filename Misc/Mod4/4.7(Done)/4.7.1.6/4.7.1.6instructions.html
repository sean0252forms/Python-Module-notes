The default exception and how to use it
The code has changed again – can you see the difference?

We've added a third except branch, but this time it has no exception name specified – we can say it's anonymous or (what is closer to its actual role) it's the default. You can expect that when an exception is raised and there is no except branch dedicated to this exception, it will be handled by the default branch.

Note:

The default except branch must be the last except branch. Always!
