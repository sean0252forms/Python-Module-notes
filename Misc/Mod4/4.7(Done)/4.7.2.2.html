Congratulations! You have completed Module 4.

Well done! You've reached the end of Module 4 and completed a major milestone in your Python programming education. Here's a short summary of the objectives you've covered and become familiar with in Module 4:

the defining and using of functions âˆ’ their rationale, purpose, conventions, and traps;
the concept of passing arguments in different ways and setting their default values, along with the mechanisms of returning the function's results;
name scope issues;
new data aggregates: tuples and dictionaries, and their role in data processing;
the concept of exceptions, and the importance of code testing and debugging.

You are now ready to take the module quiz and attempt the final challenge: Module 4 Test, which will help you gauge what you've learned so far.
